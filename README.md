Add a new module which uses the output of acdc and generates a cluster which is associated with two secure architecture decisions.
Our modification:
Adding new module securityAnalysis.py in the ACDC technique source code.
Add coding for visualizing the result on the reference of d3.js.


securityType: '1' means "Access Control", '2' means "Threat and Risk Assessment".

In order to run this code, run: 

python securityAnalysis.py \<inputFile\> \<outputFile\> \<securityType\>
